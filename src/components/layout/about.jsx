        <p>
          I am a Fullstack Engineer with a passion for TypeScript, Web Design, and problem
          solving. I am looking forward to the next step in my transition from the service industry into tech.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most recently I have been working as an intern for a Software company developing an app for
          High School students. Working on complex features like a Rich Text Editor, Data Visualation, and
          custom react components has been an incredible and irreplaceable opportunity.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am certain that my experience as a cook and server, which are environments that only function
          correctly when working together, will make me a valuable asset to my future team as an engineer.
